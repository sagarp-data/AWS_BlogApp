• Goaled towards developing a scalable, low-latency React-Node-MySQL blog application that can deliver a good user experience.

• The blog application allows users to register, login, and view blog posts from other users. 

• Users can also write and publish their own blog posts and browse through articles sorted by categories.

• The AWS deployment of the application has been done using multiple Amazon Web Services like Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Beanstalk, and Relational Database Service (RDS) with MySQL instance.

• Used infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to provision and automate the creation of my cloud services, resulting in increased efficiency and streamlined processes.

• AWS Code Pipelines were used for the robust feature set, tight security controls, and flexibility to customize build processes• Goaled towards developing a scalable, low-latency React-Node-MySQL blog application that can deliver a good user experience.
